To develop a CNN model for classifying images of plastic waste, you'll follow a series of steps, including data collection, model architecture design, training, and evaluation.For the Data Collection step, the goal is to gather and prepare a dataset of images for your CNN model.

# WasteClassificationCNN
AICTE Virtual Internship project for Cycle 3 students on waste classification using CNN

Dataset for the project is linked here:
